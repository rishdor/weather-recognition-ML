# Weather Image Classification

## Description
This project is a machine learning model that classifies images of weather into various categories such as 'sunny', 'cloudy', 'rainy', etc.

## Dataset
The model was trained on a combination of three different weather image datasets: [Dataset 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jehanbhathena/weather-dataset)), [Dataset 2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/polavr/twoclass-weather-classification), and [Dataset 3](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijaygiitk/multiclass-weather-dataset). All images were resized to 100x100 pixels for uniformity before training.
